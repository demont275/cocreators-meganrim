Meganrim is an alpha project in my journey with CoCreators/uto. This application focuses on communities that feature emerging AI non-playable characters (NPCs). The story unfolds in the world of Skyrim, inspired by my sister Megan, who adds a unique touch to the narrative.

This project invites co-creators from various backgrounds to collaborate on a story-driven video about technoheroism and utopia. Whether you want to brainstorm ideas or discuss the ethics of AI NPCs, your input is welcome. We encourage artists, writers, musicians, and anyone interested in pushing the limits of creativity using video production.

Most of the video will unfold through a first-person perspective, emulating realistic gameplay.
